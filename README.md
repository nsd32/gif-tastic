# gif-tastic

Gif-tastic allows users to view giphys of their favorite tv show (or any keyword that they’d like to add to the default list). Click any button at the top (default list) to make the giphys display on the page. Once the giphys are on the page, click the image to make it animate. If you’d like to add keywords to the list, type it in the search bar and click the add button.
